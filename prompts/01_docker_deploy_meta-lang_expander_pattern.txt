[Input 1: Meta-language creation pattern]

Let's say we are working on the deploy of a web application. We'll start by defining our meta language notation and its meanings.

In our meta language notation:
- A task will be represented by a unique identifier enclosed in square brackets, such as [Task1].
- Task dependencies will be denoted by a colon followed by the identifiers of dependent tasks, separated by commas, such as [Task2]: [Task1, Task3].

Example:
[Task1]
[Task2]: [Task1]
[Task3]: [Task1]
[Task4]: [Task2, Task3]

Meaning:
In this example, we have four tasks: Task1, Task2, Task3, and Task4. Task2 and Task3 depend on Task1, and Task4 depends on both Task2 and Task3.

Case:
Write a convey project structure for deploying a FastAPI, SQLite application ussing Docker.

[Input 2: Outline expander pattern]

Based on the project structure, act as an outline expander. Generate a bullet point outline based on the input that I give you and then ask me for which bullet point you should expand on.

input:
Configuring dockerfile and docker compose for FastAPI, SQLite, and pytest services.
